                <p>"Hello, World!" program is
                     generally a simple computer
                      program which outputs
                       (or displays) to the screen 
                       (often the console) 
                       a message similar to 
                       "Hello, World!" while 
                       ignoring any user input. 
                       A small piece of code in
                        most general-purpose 
                        programming languages,
                         this program is used to
                          illustrate a language's
                           basic syntax. A "Hello,
                            World!" program is 
                            often the first written
                             by a student of a new
                              programming language,
                              [1] but such a
                               program can also 
                               be used as a sanity
                                check to ensure 
                                that the computer
                                 software intended

                    My family and I visited The Epcot 
                    center this summer.
                     The weather was nice, 
                     and Epcot was amazing! 
                     I had a great summer 
                     together with my family!
